- Obtain Number of available genomes each of the 15 hemimetabolous orders + in all endopterygota (holometabolous)

- [Lits of hemimetabolous orders](Hemimetabolous_orders.txt) obtained from the book ["Insect Metamorphosis"](https://www.elsevier.com/books/insect-metamorphosis/belles/978-0-12-813020-9) by Xavier Belles.

- Check the [Jupyter Notebook](Get_Available_Genomes_by_lienage.ipynb) for script + results.
	- Notebook based on my other repository [Number_genomes_available_in_NCBI](https://github.com/guillemylla/Number_genomes_available_in_NCBI/blob/main/Get_Available_Genomes_by_Taxon.ipynb)
